                    Here, each campaign with more than 15,000 identified donors is represented by a bubble. The size of
                    the bubble corresponds with the number of known donors and the color with the candidate's party.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The campaigns are arranged horizontally according to the percentage of their donors who live in
                    majority-white zipcodes. Just over 67% of people in the United States live in zipcodes that are more
                    than 50% non-Hispanic white, though people living in these zipcodes make up roughly 75% of donors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that Republican campaigns are grouped more to the right side, indicating that their donors draw
                    more heavily from majority-white zipcodes. While Democratic campaigns draw less frequently from these
                    zipcodes, they also span a wider range. Residents in majority-white zipcode comprise less than
                    two-thirds of donors for some Democrats, and nearly 90% for others.

                <p>
                    Here, the campaigns have been arranged vertically according to the percentage of donors from zipcodes
                    with high Bachelor’s degree attainment (top 25%). By definition, these make up just 25% of zipcodes,
                    yet they make up virtually the entire donor base for the campaigns near the top of the chart.

                    Donors to the Republican campaigns tend to more frequently live in majority-white zipcodes, and less
                    frequently live in zipcodes with high Bachelor’s degree attainment.

                    For Democratic candidates, it is the opposite. Their donors are often from more racially diverse
                    zipcodes, and zipcodes with high bachelors degree attainment
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Note also that Democratic campaigns are generally clustered less closely than the Republican ones.

                    Look, for example, at the gap between donors to Bernie Sanders' campaign on the left, Amy Klobuchar's
                    campaign to the right, indicating that Klobuchar's campaign drew many more donors from majority-white
                    zipcodes.

                    The campaigns of freshman Representatives. Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Tlaib, and Pressley are also
                    clustered together near the left end of the plot, along with 2020 progressive insurgents Cori Bush
                    and Jamaal Bowman.

                    A skeptical reader might wonder how much these patterns are simply due to geography. All else even,
                    we would expect donors to Steve Bullock's senate campaign in Montana to look different than the
                    donors to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's congressional campaign in the Bronx.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To help account for this, the donors have now been filtered to include only those from outside of a
                    candidate's district or state (for presidential campaigns, nothing has changed). For a few candidates,
                    such as Senators Merkley, Cornyn, and Markey, this makes a big difference. By and large, though,
                    the divides between and within parties look very similar, even with in-district donors excluded.

                    Here the y-axis has been switched to indicate the percentage of donors who come from high-income
                    zipcodes (top 25%). These zipcodes produce a very large percentage of campaign contributions overall
                    (note that the y-axis is clipped at the bottom)
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    While Democratic donors, on average, are more likely to live in high-income zipcodes, the divide
                    between parties is much more muddled when looking at income level instead of Bachelor’s attainment,
                    particularly among more major candidates. This supports evidence found in polling that party support
                    is divided much more by formal education level than by income. Democratic party candidates, however,
                    span a much wider range, suggesting a Democratic donor’s income level may have a strong impact on the
                    kinds of candidates that they support within the party.

                <p>
                    Over $5 billion has gone to federal election candidates during the 2020 campaign cycle. The increasingly
                    popular ActBlue and WinRed fundraising platforms allow us to understand better than ever not just where
                    that money is going, but also who it is coming from.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    While FEC records don't provide demographic information about individual donors, they do provide a
                    zipcode. Because zipcodes in the United States remain generally
                    <a href="https://talkpoverty.org/2015/12/17/american-dream-zip-codes-affordable-housing/">segregated</a>,
                    we can attempt to better understand the donors backing various campaigns by looking at the
                    demographics of their zipcode. While gender does not vary significantly by geography, race/ethnicity,
                    education level, and income level often do and these features expose key divides, not just between,
                    but within parties.

                We can look at overlap more directly by finding donors who contributed to multiple candidates.
                The diagram below shows candidates who share individual donors with the selected candidate in the center.
                The higher the overlap, the larger the outside candidate's "bubble" is.

                    Unique donors are determined using a combination of first name,
                    last name and zipcode. This creates the possibility of both false positives (two Jane Smiths in the
                    same zipcode) and false negatives (Jonathan Smith sometimes donates as Jon Smith, or Jon Smith moves
                    homes during the election cycle). Others who have worked with donor data sometimes require a matching
                    employer name as well. This creates a very small chance of a false positive (it's very unlikely that
                    there are two Jane Smiths living in the same zipcode with the same employer), but creates many more false
                    negatives (Jon Smith might change jobs mid-election cycle or he might mark his employer as "Smith High School"
                    on one donation and "Smith H.S." on another). On balance, when looking at donor overlap, I decided that
                    requiring a matching employer was too stringent of a requirement and would lead to missing too many
                    donor overlaps. As it is, the analysis very likely underrepresents the amount of overlap due to false negatives,
                    but it misses them uniformly, across candidates.

                    The use of the WinRed fundraising platform among Republican candidates is relatively new and still
                    less prevalent than the ActBlue platform among Democratic candidates. Since much of the data regarding
                    smaller-money donors (<$200) comes from the platforms' filings, GOP candidates generally have fewer
                    <i>identified</i> donors than Democratic candidates. Even among candidates who have adopted these platforms,
                    many small transactions take place outside and the campaigns are only required to report contributions
                    from donors who give more at least $200 in aggregate. This means we don't have a true donor count for any
                    campaign, but we can generally get much closer for Democratic ones.
