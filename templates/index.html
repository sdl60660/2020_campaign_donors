                    This map plots all money received by 2020 campaign committees based on the home state of the donor.
                    Each dot represents $1 million contributed and they are colored by the party of the candidates (with
                    yellow representing Libertarians and gray representing Independents). <strong>Hover over any state to see totals

                    Note the two large islands off of the east coast. The first represents money that candidates gave
                    to their own campaigns. More than 85% of this money came from two candidates: Michael Bloomberg and Tom
                    Steyer. This money can be tied to a donor location, but has been removed from the map for clarity.

                    Just north of Puerto Rico sits all money that cannot be tied to a 2020 donor. This includes any donations
                    totaling less than $200 and not contributed through the popular ActBlue/WinRed platforms. It also includes
                    money transferred to the campaign from other committees, most notably joint fundraising committees.

                    But by if we divide by office type, it becomes clear that that gap is mostly due to the presidential race,
                    where Democratic donors contributed significant sums of money to over two dozen campaigns.

                    Here the money has been split among the top fundraisers by office type. Note that the totals for all
                    remaining candidates have been moved to the right side.

                <br>
                <p>
                    One thing that becomes clear is how much larger presidential fundraising operations are relative to even the most
                    prolific congressional fundraisers. Another is the size, in particular, of the Bloomberg and Steyer campaigns.

                    By separating out self-contributions, we can better understand and compare the campaigns' fundraising
                    operations and it now becomes clear that Bloomberg and Steyer's massive fundraising advantages are due
                    almost entirely to the money that they gave their own campaigns.

                    We can take this a step further, by separating out transfers (and other small, miscellaneous
                    fundraising sources) from individual contributions, at the top. Note how much of Trump's fundraising
                    is made up of transfers from other committees. These transfers mostly come from joint fundraising
                    committees such as the "Make America Great Again Committee", which splits its money between Trump's
                    campaign and the RNC.

                    Individual contributions can then be split between larger donors ($200 or more) on the left
                    and smaller donors (less than $200) on the right.

                <p>
                    Note, for example, that smaller donors make up nearly 80% of Rep. Ocasio-Cortez's
                    campaign fundraising, while making up just a small fraction of the fundraising for Tom Steyer's
                    presidential campaign (despite him successfully meeting the 130,000 donor requirement for the
                    Democratic debates).

                    Finally, we can introduce money going to Super PACs/Carey Committees. These committees do not have
                    formal ties to any parties or campaigns, but many of them frequently spend on behalf of candidates
                    and can often be broadly categorized as liberal (blue) or conservative (red). They can accept unlimited
                    contributions from individuals, while individual contributions to a campaign's primary committee cannot
                    exceed $2,800.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In total, these committees have raised about $1.2 billion in the 2020 cycle, a very large sum of money,
                    but just 12% of the nearly $10 billion raised by campaigns (and notably just a few million more than
                    Bloomberg's contributions to his own campaign).

                <p>
                    While Super PAC money isn't formally tied to campaigns, there are several PACs which act solely in support
                    of a individual candidates (with varying levels of coordination). We can map this money to the major
                    presidential candidates above to get a clearer picture of where all of their financial support comes from,
                    direct or indirect.
                <p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Despite large sums of money going to presidential candidates, the vast majority
                    of Super PAC money is not affiliated with individual candidates, but rather in broad support of congressional
                    majorities or liberal/conservative causes. The two largest Super PACS support Democratic and Republican
                    senate majorities, respectively.

                    Note that donors to the Republican campaigns tend to come more frequently from majority-white zipcodes,
                    and less frequently from zipcodes with high bachelors degree attainment.

                    For Democratic candidates, it is the opposite. Their donors are often from more racially diverse zipcodes,
                    and zipcodes with high bachelors degree attainment. However, there is a significant spread among Democratic
                    candidates.

                    Look, for example, at the gap between donors to Bernie Sanders' campaign on the left, Amy Klobuchar's
                    campaign to the right, indicating that Klobuchar's campaign drew many more donors from majority-white

                    Here the y-axis has been switched to indicate the percentage of donors who come from high-income
                    zipcodes (top 25%). These zipcodes produce a very large percentage of campaign contributions overall
                    (note that the y-axis is clipped at the bottom), but there remains a significant gap between parties

                    While a little less stark, the divide between parties holds if we look at income level instead of

                    when looking at income than it was for bachelors attainment.

                    More than $10 billion has gone to federal election candidates during the 2020 campaign cycle. The
                    increasingly popular ActBlue and WinRed platforms allow us to understand better than ever not just
                    where that money is going, but how it is getting there and who it is coming from.

                Finally, we can look at donors who contributed to multiple candidates to better understand
                overlap between candidates. The diagram below shows candidates who share individual donors with
                the selected candidate in the center. The higher the overlap, the larger the outside candidate's
                "bubble" is.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                You can <strong>hover over any bubble for more details</strong> or <strong>double-click on any bubble to
                switch the center candidate</strong>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Note that by default, the diagram will display "outbound" overlap (designated with <span id="blue-highlight">blue</span>
                arrows), meaning it shows the percentage of the selected candidate's donors who donated to the outside candidate.
                It can be toggled to instead display "inbound" overlap (designated with the <span id="green-highlight">green</span>
                arrows), meaning the percentage of the outside candidate's donors who donated to the selected candidate.

                    Unique donors are determined using a combination of first name,
                    last name and zipcode. This creates the possibility of both false positives (two Jane Smiths in the
                    same zipcode) and false negatives (Jonathan Smith sometimes donates as Jon Smith, or Jon Smith moves
                    homes during the election cycle). Others who have worked with donor data sometimes require a matching
                    employer name as well. This creates a very small chance of a false positive (it's very unlikely that
                    there are two Jane Smiths living in the same zipcode with the same employer), but creates many more false
                    negatives (Jon Smith might change jobs mid-election cycle or he might mark his employer as "Smith High School"
                    on one donation and "Smith H.S." on another). On balance, when looking at donor overlap, I decided that
                    requiring a matching employer was too stringent of a requirement and would lead to missing too many
                    donor overlaps. As it is, the analysis very likely underrepresents the amount of overlap due to false negatives,
                    but it misses them uniformly, across candidates.

                    The use of the WinRed fundraising platform among Republican candidates is relatively new and still
                    less prevalent than the ActBlue platform among Democratic candidates. Since much of the data regarding
                    smaller-money donors (<$200) comes from the platforms' filings, GOP candidates generally have fewer
                    <i>identified</i> donors than Democratic candidates. Even among candidates who have adopted these platforms,
                    many small transactions take place outside and the campaigns are only required to report contributions
                    from donors who give more at least $200 in aggregate. This means we don't have a true donor count for any
                    campaign, but we can generally get much closer for Democratic ones.
