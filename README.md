# Campaign Donor Demographics

Visualization project based on FEC records with a particular focus on candidate donor overlap and mapping donors to zipcode demographics. We can't know the demographics of individual campaign donors, but we can start to understand the kinds of donors making up a campaign's base by looking at the zipcodes that they live in. This project uses D3 for visualization component and Python/PostgreSQL for the data pre-processing.
